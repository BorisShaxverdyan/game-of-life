# Game Of Life

This project was written using typescript.

To run this project you must first compile it.
To compile it you need to install "typescript" npm package globally - on Windows open cmd with admin access and run "npm i -g typescript".
Then in project root path run "npm start" and it automatically will create "build" folder and run it in "localhost:3000".

If you don’t want to install "typescript" or for some reason you can’t compile the project there is a ready-made project build.
Just in project root path run "node build/server.js" and the project will run.
